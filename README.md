# merrow
A randomizer/IPS patch generator for Quest 64, and also for generic binary editing use.

***

Merrow is a tool for generating IPS patches, primarily to be applied to the NA/U dotZ64 version of Quest. It's the first steps of a randomizer test. You'll need an IPS capable patching tool, like Lunar or Ninja. 
If you don't know what that means, you probably don't need this.

It also has an advanced function of being a universal clean IPS patch generator, for those who know what they're doing and just want to test some specific hex address writing.

Merrow is experimental and therefore offered without warranty. Merrow patches are confirmed to work on the NA/U dotZ64 version, but may still cause unknown errors and crashes. Expect many crashes. Patches are not made to work on the NA/U dotN64 version or any other region. Always back up files before applying. Contains no game files.

Merrow was originally developed in Unity, this repository is the C# Winforms port, to make it more widely available to edit and use.

Latest build available at https://hangedman.itch.io/merrow.
Thanks to the Eltale Monsters Discord for the data and support.
