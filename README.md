# Merrow

Merrow is a tool for generating IPS patches, primarily to be applied to the NA/U dotZ64 version of Quest 64, offering many randomizer and quality-of-life options. You'll need an IPS-capable patching tool to use the patches it creates, like Lunar or Ninja.

It also has two advanced data tools that aren't specific to Quest 64 and may be handy to coders and romhackers: a universal clean IPS patch generator, for those who know what they're doing and just want to test some specific hex address patching; and a binary file reader, that allows you to specify a series of addresses and lengths and easily export hexadecimal data from any binary file.

Developed by Hangedman (Jonah Davidson), with the aid and support of many people, especially the Eltale Monsters Discord. Credits are available in the program itself.
Merrow was originally developed in Unity, this repository is the C# Winforms port, to make it more widely available to edit and use.

# Disclaimer

Merrow is experimental and therefore offered without warranty. Merrow patches are confirmed to work on the NA/U dotZ64 version, but may still cause unknown errors and crashes. Expect potential crashes. Patches are not made to work on the NA/U dotN64 version or any other region. Always back up files before applying.
Merrow contains no copyrighted game data or files.
